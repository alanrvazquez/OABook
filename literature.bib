  abstract      = {Descent methods for combinatorial optimization proceed by performing a sequence of local changes on an initial solution which improve each time the value of an objective function until a local optimum is found. Several metaheuristics have been proposed which extend in various ways this scheme and avoid being trapped in local optima. For example, Hansen and Mladenovic have recently proposed the variable neighborhood search method which has not yet been applied to many combinatorial optimization problems. The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptation of this new method to the graph coloring problem. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonregular two-level fractional factorial designs are designs which cannot be specified in terms of a set of defining contrasts. The aliasing properties of nonregular designs can be compared by using a generalisation of the minimum aberration criterion called minimum $G_{2}-aberration$ . Until now, the only nontrivial designs that are known to have minimum $G_{2}-aberration$ are designs for n runs and $m \geq n - 5$ factors. In this paper, a number of construction results are presented which allow minimum $G_{2}-aberration$ designs to be found for many of the cases with n = 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 and 96 runs and $m \geq n/2 - 2$ factors.},

  Abstract                 = {The definition of an orthogonal array imposes an important geometric property: the projection of an OA(Î» 2t, 2k, t), a Î» 2t-run orthogonal array with k two-level factors and strength t, onto any t factors consists of Î» copies of the complete 2t factorial. In this article, projections of an OA(N, 2k, t) onto t + 1 and t + 2 factors are considered. The projection onto any t + 1 factors must be one of three types: one or more copies of the complete 2t+1 factorial, one or more copies of a half-replicate of 2t+1 or a combination of both. It is also shown that for k â¥ t + 2, only when N is a multiple of 2t+1 can the projection onto some t + 1 factors be copies of a half-replicate of 2t+1. Therefore, if N is not a multiple of 2t+1, then the projection of an OA(N, 2k, t) with k â¥ t + 2 onto any t + 1 factors must contain at least one complete 2t+1 factorial. Some properties of projections onto t + 2 factors are established and are applied to show that if N is not a multiple of 8, then for any OA(N, 2k, 2) with k â¥ 4, the projection onto any four factors has the property that all the main effects and two-factor interactions of these four factors are estimable when the higher-order interactions are negligible.},

  abstract      = {The performance of minimum aberration two-level fractional factorial designs is studied under two criteria of model robustness. Simple sufficient conditions for a design to dominate another design with respect to each of these two criteria are derived. It is also shown that a minimum aberration design of resolution III or higher maximizes the number of two-factor interactions which are not aliases of main effects and, subject to that condition, minimizes the sum of squares of the sizes of alias sets of two-factor interactions. This roughly says that minimum aberration designs tend to make the sizes of the alias sets very uniform. It follows that minimum aberration is a good surrogate for the two criteria of model robustness that are studied here. Examples are given to show that minimum aberration designs are indeed highly efficient.},

  abstract      = {The well-known, challenging problem of resource-constrained project scheduling is addressed. A solution scheme based on variable neighbourhood search is presented. The solution is coded by using activity sequences that are valid in terms of precedence constraints. The sequences are turned into valid active schedules through a serial scheduler. The search of the solution space is carried out via generating valid sequences using two types of move strategy. Much of the power of the solution scheme is attributable to repeatedly employing effective lower bounding and precedence augmentation, both of which serve to reduce the solution space. The effectiveness of the solution scheme is demonstrated through extensive experimentation with a standard set of 2040 benchmark problem instances. The best-known solutions have been improved upon for 48 instances and the best-known lower bounds have also been improved upon for 148 problem instances. The results are inferior to the best-known for a relatively small number of problem instances, but even then the average deviation is very small indeed. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

It was first proposed in 1997 and has since then rapidly developed both in its methods and its applications. In the present paper, these two aspects are thoroughly reviewed and an extensive bibliography is provided. Moreover, one section is devoted to newcomers. It consists of steps for developing a heuristic for any particular problem. Those steps are common to the implementation of other metaheuristics.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we present an efficient variable neighborhood search heuristic for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. The objective is to design least cost routes for a fleet of identically capacitated vehicles to service geographically scattered customers with known demands. The variable neighborhood search procedure is used to guide a set of standard improvement heuristics. In addition, a strategy reminiscent of the guided local search metaheuristic is used to help escape local minima. The developed solution method is specifically aimed at solving very large scale real-life vehicle routing problems. To speed up the method and cut down memory usage, new implementation concepts are used. Computational experiments on 32 existing large scale benchmarks, as well as on 20 new very large scale problem instances, demonstrate that the proposed method is fast, competitive and able to find high-quality solutions for problem instances with up to 20,000 customers within reasonable CPU times. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Foldover is a commonly used follow-up strategy in experimental designs. All existing foldover designs were constructed by reversing the sign of columns of the initial design. We propose a new methodology by allowing the permutation of columns in foldover. Focusing on resolution IV designs, we show that almost all designs are better than existing results with respect to the minimum aberration criterion. While augmenting a design by a foldover with column permutations may result in a nonregular combined design, the proposed designs all have a resolution of 4.5 or higher, for which no two-factor interaction is fully aliased with any other two-factor interactions.},

  abstract      = {Generalized aberration (GA) is one of the most frequently used criteria to quantify the suitability of an orthogonal array (OA) to be used as an experimental design. The two main motivations for \{GA\} are that it quantifies bias in a main-effects only model and that it is a good surrogate for estimation efficiencies of models with all the main effects and some two-factor interaction components. We demonstrate that these motivations are not appropriate for three-level \{OAs\} of strength 3 and we propose a direct classification with other criteria instead. To illustrate, we classified complete series of three-level strength-3 \{OAs\} with 27, 54 and 81 runs using the \{GA\} criterion, the rank of the matrix with two-factor interaction contrasts, the estimation efficiency of two-factor interactions, the projection estimation capacity, and a new model robustness criterion. For all of the series, we provide a list of admissible designs according to these criteria.},

  Abstract                 = {Fractional factorial (FF) designs are widely used in practice and typically are chosen according to the minimum aberration criterion. A sequential algorithm is developed for constructing efficient FF designs. A construction procedure is proposed that allows a design to be constructed only from its minimum aberration projection in the sequential buildup process. To efficiently identify nonisomorphic designs, designs are categorized according to moment projection pattern. A fast isomorphism checking procedure is developed by matching the factors using their delete-one-factor projections. This algorithm is used to completely enumerate all 128-run designs of resolution 4, all 256-run designs of resolution 4 up to 17 factors, all 512-run designs of resolution 5, all 1024-run designs of resolution 6, and all 2048- and 4,096-run designs of resolution 7. A method is proposed for constructing minimum aberration (MA) designs using only a partial catalog of some good designs. Three approaches to constructing good designs with a large number of factors are suggested. Efficient designs, often with MA, are tabulated up to 40, 80, 160, 45, 47, and 65 factors for 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4,096 runs, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The Nordstrom-Robinson code is a well-known nonlinear code in coding theory. This paper explores the statistical properties of this nonlinear code. Many nonregular designs with 32, 64, 128 and 256 runs and 7-16 factors are derived from it. It is shown that these nonregular designs are better than regular designs of the same size in terms of resolution, aberration and projectivity. Furthermore, many of these nonregular designs are shown to have generalised minimum aberration among all possible designs. Seven orthogonal arrays are shown to have unique word-length pattern and four of them are shown to be unique up to isomorphism.},

  abstract   = {The sequential design approach to response surface exploration is often viewed as advantageous as it provides the opportunity to learn from each successive experiment with the ultimate goal of determining optimum operating conditions for the system or process under study. Recent literature has explored factor screening and response surface optimization using only one three-level design to handle situations where conducting multiple experiments is prohibitive. Themost straightforward and accessible analysis strategy for such designs is to first perform amain-effects only analysis to screen important factors before projecting the design onto these factors to conduct response surface exploration. This article proposes the use of optimal designs with minimal aliasing (MA designs) and demonstrates that they are more effective at screening important factors than the existing designs recommended for single-design response surface exploration. For comparison purposes, we construct 27-run MA designs with up to 13 factors and demonstrate their utility using established design criterion and a simulation study. Copyright},

This design requires only 17 experimental runs. The resulting model was then used to simulate 10,000 runs that account for the variability in the inputs expected on manufacturing scale. The extent of protein polymerization was predicted to be within specifications for all simulated runs, demonstrating the robustness of the unit operation for subsequent process validation and future commercial manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical decolorization of the Reactive Violet 5 azo dye on a boron-doped diamond anode was used as a model process to test a novel definitive screening design (DSD). This method allows a dramatic reduction in the number of experiments needed to investigate those systems characterized by a large number of variables. In this study, the effect of nine quantitative parameters was investigated: initial dye concentration (60--120 mg L?1), current density (100--500 A m?2), NaCl concentration (5--20 mM), Na2SO4 concentration (35--65 mM), pH (3--11), temperature (20--45 {\textdegree}C), inter-electrode distance (0.5--3.5 cm), stirring rate (250--750 rpm) and electrolysis time (2--8 min). Analysis of DSD data showed that four out of the nine factors (initial dye concentration, current density, pH and electrolysis time) were statistically significant. These factors were retained for process characterization using a subsequent central composite design. Overall, the number of experiments was reduced from over 500 to only 41, thus confirming the validity of the proposed approach as a time-saving and efficient method.},

  abstract   = {Screening designs are attractive for assessing the relative impact of a large number of factors on a response of interest. Experimenters often prefer quantitative factors with three levels over two-level factors because having three levels allows for some assessment of curvature in the factor--response relationship. Yet, the most familiar screening designs limit each factor to only two levels. We propose a new class of designs that have three levels, provide estimates of main effects that are unbiased by any second-order effect, require only one more than twice as many runs as there are factors, and avoid confounding of any pair of second-order effects. Moreover, for designs having six factors or more, our designs allow for the efficient estimation of the full quadratic model in any three factors. In this respect, our designs may render follow-up experiments unnecessary in many situations, thereby increasing the efficiency of the entire experimentation process. We also provide an algorithm for design construction.},

Such a design enables to investigate the effect of synthesis parameters including their interactions or quadratic effects, on the material properties. The mesopore formation was influenced mostly by the ratio precursor/surfactant, other significant effects were curing time and carbonization temperature. The micropore formation was significantly influenced by the curing time and the carbonization temperature. The DSD was used to optimize the mesoporous surface area which could improve its potential as adsorbent. Via a validation experiment, a material with optimal mesoporous surface area (393m2/g) was synthesized, showing a total surface area of 712m2/g and a large pore volume of 0.78cm3/g. The different mesoporous carbons, synthesized according to the DSD, were tested for the adsorption of bisphenol A (BPA). This allowed to investigate the effect of material properties on the adsorption capacity, which varied between 12 and 163mg/g. Via regression analysis, the mesoporous surface area and the carbon content of the mesoporous carbons were identified as the main factors influencing the adsorption of BPA. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Breakthroughs in highly automated and parallelized upstream process development have led to technologies such as the 250-mL automated mini bioreactor (ambr250{\texttrademark}) system. Furthermore, developments in modern design of experiments (DoE) have promoted the use of definitive screening design (DSD) as an efficient method to combine factor screening and characterization. Here we utilize the 24-bioreactor ambr250{\texttrademark} system with 10-factor DSD to demonstrate a systematic experimental workflow to efficiently characterize an Escherichia coli (E. coli) fermentation process for recombinant protein production. The generated process model is further valiyeard by laboratory-scale experiments and shows how the strategy is useful for quality by design (QbD) approaches to control strategies for late-stage characterization. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

  abstract   = {To explore the projection efficiency of a design, Tsai, et al [2000. Projective three-level main effects designs robust to model uncertainty. Biometrika 87, 467-475] introduced the Q criterion to compare three-level main-effects designs for quantitative factors that allow the consideration of interactions in addition to main effects. In this paper, we extend their method and focus on the case in which experimenters have some prior knowledge, in advance of running the experiment, about the probabilities of effects being non-negligible. A criterion which incorporates experimenters' prior beliefs about the importance of each effect is introduced to compare orthogonal, or nearly orthogonal, main effects designs with robustness to interactions as a secondary consideration. We show that this criterion, exploiting prior information about model uncertainty, can lead to more appropriate designs reflecting experimenters' prior beliefs. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.
